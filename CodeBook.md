Code book  for averageData.txt==========================##IntroductionThis data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. derived from the UCI HAR dataset:reference: *Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012* The first two variables (Activity and Subject) are the grouping variable. The remaining "Mean" variable are the mean (calculated using the mean() function) of normalised data bounded within [-1,1]. ##Grouping variables:####Activity     *groups:*- Walking-
